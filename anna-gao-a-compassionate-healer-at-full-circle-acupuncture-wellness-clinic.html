<p>Hi, and welcome back to my blog! For my second article, I’d like you to meet Anna Gao, a dedicated practitioner at Full Circle Acupuncture &amp; Wellness Clinic. We had a wonderful discussion about her practice, and she was extremely kind, as well as willing to answer questions for as long as I needed!</p>
<p>For the past 10 months, she has been passionately practicing acupuncture, Chinese medicine, and massage therapy, with a focus on fertility and pregnancy care. Anna's definition of success lies in the joy of helping her patients achieve successful pregnancies, and her reputation boasts a high success rate!</p>
<p>Her daily routine has many parts, all to ensure her client’s satisfaction!. She starts her day by caring for her beloved plant in the waiting area, and then moves on to viewing and responding to emails, and also checking + sanitizing her work area, preparing a soothing ambience for her patients. As I see it, Anna believes in nurturing both her clients and nature!</p>
<p>Inside her healing work, Anna finds delight in connecting with people, witnessing their progress, and solving their health concerns. When she’s not seeing patients, she enjoys marketing and upgrading her social media to spread awareness about the benefits of acupuncture and Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>To be honest, I never studied anything much about medicine, much less about acupuncture and wellness, but this interview alone has helped me learn so much from Anna! I am incredibly grateful to have had the pleasure of speaking to such a skilled and dedicated healer like Anna Gao, as she has made our conversation both enlightening and memorable!</p>
