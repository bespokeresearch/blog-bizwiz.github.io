<p>Hello! Welcome back to another post on my blog, where I’ve had the pleasure to interview Dr. Daniel Corallo, the heart and soul of DC Chiropractic; where exceptional care and chiropractic  services have been provided for six remarkable years.  </p>
<p>From what we’ve discussed, I can tell that Dr. Corallo is driven by a passion for offering top-notch care, since he bravely took the risk of starting his own business! He provides service for the whole family, and enjoys helping people get rid of their chronic pain, any muscle or bone injuries, and aids with rehabilitation after surgeries. He manages to provide a feel-good atmosphere too, providing helpful insight and mentorship to both his clients AND his colleagues! </p>
<p>While business success is essential, Dr. Corallo measures true achievement by the impact on his patients' lives. He spoke to me about how witnessing their improvement and well-being not only brings the ultimate reward and fuels his passion for healing.  Not only that, but he truly loves to solve the puzzles of complex injury cases and learn about his client’s history.</p>
<p>In the interview, I asked him about his day-to-day routine, to which he talked about doing everything from checking his schedule to stocking up the medical rooms! Every morning, he starts off by just doing some general stuff around the office, then moves on to preparing his schedule for his patients, checking and responding to any emails that he may have received, and prepping the medical rooms. Just from this part of our conversation, I can already tell that he is a hardworking doctor!</p>
<p>To finish off, I’d just like to give many thanks to Dr. Corallo, for his patience and enthusiasm during the interview! And even after interviewing multiple other chiropractors, he certainly didn’t fail at teaching me something new about the industry! I am very grateful for the experience, and fortunate to have been able to speak to him!</p>
