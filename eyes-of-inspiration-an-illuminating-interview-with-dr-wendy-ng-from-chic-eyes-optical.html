<p>Hey there, readers!</p>
<p>Get ready to be wowed because I had the most incredible chat with Dr. Wendy Ng from Chic Eyes Optical! She's an optometrist, and her world revolves around eye exams and all things eye care. On top of that, she also runs an optical where they sell glasses and dive into the business side of things! How cool is that?</p>
<p>She's been at Chic Eyes Optical since November 2022, and before that, she's been an optometrist for almost 7 years! She used to work as an associate, but guess what? Owning her own practice had always been on the back of her mind, so when the golden opportunity came knocking, she took a leap of faith and went for it! </p>
<p>Now, her practice serves a bunch of lucky King City folks and even some from Newmarket, Richmond Hill, and Vaughan! Dr. Wendy's main goal is helping people with their eyes – and getting them to see better and improve their life is her mission! On the optical side, it's all about finding the perfect eyewear that not only improves their vision but also makes them look fabulous. Because let's be real, glasses are not just functional – they're a style statement too!</p>
<p>Currently, she's the mastermind behind Chic Eyes Optical, and let me tell you, she's the queen of multitasking! From the medical side to the business side – she's on it. Think human resources, hiring, payroll, finances, inventory, social media, marketing – you name it, she's got it covered!</p>
<p>Interacting with patients, hearing their stories, and seeing their eye progress is what truly fuels Dr. Ng’s fire! She even mentioned to me this one time, when a 6-year-old girl came in for an eye exam, and it turned out she had poor vision in one eye; as opposed to the problem being misdiagnosed as dyslexia. After Dr. Wendy worked her magic, the girl's reading level shot up two grades, and she's now a bookworm in the making! And that's not all – Dr. Wendy's detected eye cancers and even saved a life by spotting a blocked artery. Talk about being a real-life hero! She certainly proved to me that her work not only strives to help people’s eyesight, but to provide them a better quality of living as well!</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to say thank you to Dr. Wendy Ng for her time, and for helping me dive into what it’s like to work in the optical and optometry industry! I have learned so much from our call, and I can say with confidence that Dr. Ng's passion and dedication for eye care is truly awe-inspiring. Plus, her stories of transforming young readers and even saving lives through her keen eye left me in complete admiration!</p>
