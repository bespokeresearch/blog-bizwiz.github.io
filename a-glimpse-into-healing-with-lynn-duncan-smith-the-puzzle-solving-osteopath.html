<p>Hey, fantastic readers!</p>
<p>Get ready for an exclusive journey into the world of healthcare as I chat with the remarkable Lynn Duncan-Smith, the mastermind behind Lynn Duncan-Smith RMT. Brace yourselves – she’s all about the art of manual osteopathy! </p>
<p>Lynn's journey in manual therapy, a blend of physiotherapy and massage therapy, spans an impressive 23 years. But guess what? Her path wasn't always set in the medical field. Originally an art conservator, Lynn later shifted gears after taking time off for her kids. The decision was fueled by her love for people and a practical consideration – she wanted to dive into professions supported by insurance, like massage and osteopathic therapy. Smart move!</p>
<p>As the sole proprietor, Lynn's the heart and soul of her practice. Her clients span a diverse range – from pregnant women to tiny tots at just 3 weeks old, all the way to sprightly 90-year-olds seeking healing. Typically, folks visit an osteopath because something's amiss. While some go to her for maintenance, most are there to heal from their pain.</p>
<p>Success, for Lynn, is witnessing a patient leave fully healed, not needing to return. It's like solving a puzzle and watching the pieces fit perfectly – pure satisfaction! For her, witnessing patient progress, seeing exercises work their magic, and treatments taking effect fuel her passion. But Lynn's secret delight? Puzzles. She explained to me during our call that osteopathy is like solving an intricate riddle, where everything – from muscles to the bigger picture – intertwines in complexity. It's a journey of discovery, an art of unraveling the mysteries of the human body. </p>
<p>Now, as usual, the daily routine! Lynn’s day starts with meticulous preparation. She texts her patients, ensuring they're primed for the upcoming appointments. She's a bit OCD about it – after all, punctuality is key to keeping the schedule on track. Once in her office, the solo show begins. Lynn sets the stage – vacuuming, organizing files, prepping the space – it's all in the details. Each patient gets her undivided attention for 30-45 minutes, with a sweet 15-minute break in between each one, for her to manage paperwork and transition.</p>
<p>And that's a wrap for now, amazing readers! Stay tuned for more captivating interviews and stories that unveil the magic of different businesses. Until next time!</p>
