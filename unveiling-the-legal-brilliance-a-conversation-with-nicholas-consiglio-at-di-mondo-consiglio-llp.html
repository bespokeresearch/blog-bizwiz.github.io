<p>Hello, and welcome to the first article of my blog, where I had the pleasure of calling and interviewing Nicholas Consiglio, from Di mondo Consiglio LLP. He helped immerse me into the legal world, and discover what it’s like for him and Nick Di Mondo to be partners in a highly skilled firm…</p>
<p>Teaming up with his partner Nick, both him and Nicholas make an outstanding legal duo, serving a diverse range of clients, with legal services that leave customers beyond satisfied. Since 1989, they've been on call, helping clients and offering their expertise in areas like small businesses, wills and estate and investment real estate, just to name a few. It's a winning combo that's built their solid reputation!</p>
<p>During our call, Nicholas also gave me a sneak peek of his daily routine, talking about the first few things he did every morning, at work. He handles emails, phone calls, client meetings, as well as diligently drafting and reviewing legal documents. His incredible knack for not only tackling legal, but also back-end matters is seriously impressive!</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to defining success, Nicholas has it all figured out. For him, success looks like serving his clients exceptionally, and providing them satisfaction. To be honest, he genuinely enjoys being a lawyer and finds true joy in serving others. Whenever he's deep in concentration, he's in his element, totally in the flow. </p>
<p>To end things off, I am incredibly grateful to Nicholas Consiglio for our insightful discussion. I learned so much from our conversation about the importance of providing exceptional service and finding fulfillment in what you do. Thank you, Nicholas, for sharing your expertise and inspiring me on this journey!</p>
