<p>Hey, wonderful readers!</p>
<p>You are in for a treat, because I recently had a great chat with Elisa from Naturally Elisa! Hold onto your hats because this woman is a holistic nutritionist, herbalist, energy healer, and so much more! She's the ultimate wellness guru!</p>
<p>Okay, to start off – she's not just about healing, she's all about holistic wellness. From lymphatic drainage to live blood analysis and Dutch testing, she's got the magic touch! Elisa's been on this empowering journey for about 8 years, and her heart was always set on helping people through healing. Her work helps her clients realize the real power is within – she's all about helping folks realize that they are their own healers!</p>
<p>According to Elisa, success is all about how you feel. If you leave a session feeling amazing, then so does she! Her niche is mainly focused on women, usually with hormone imbalances, skin problems, fertility issues. On top of that, she does dermal treatment, lymphatic drainage and bloodwork! During our call, she also told me about how she’s definitely in the zone when she’s doing lymphatic drainage, because she really gets to connect with her clients on a tissue level; creating a deeper connection! </p>
<p>Now, let’s move on to the daily routine! For Elisa, every day is a different story, but usually she starts off by going into her office, and watering her plants. While we were talking, she explained to me how important it was to take care of the environment, as it reflects the overall vibe of the office, and I can definitely tell from that, that her office is flourishing! Next, she tidies up around her, sets up her microscope, collects blood samples and bloodwork, as well as some energy testing. On days where she works from home, she mostly does protocol, like writing up diets, plans, and recommendations for her patients! Talk about a multitasking queen!</p>
<p>Finally, I’d just like to give my thanks to Elisa for setting up and going through with this interview! She has been very kind and informative throughout the whole call, and I’ve learned things I never knew before about holistic wellness! I am very grateful to be able to have spoken with Elisa.</p>
