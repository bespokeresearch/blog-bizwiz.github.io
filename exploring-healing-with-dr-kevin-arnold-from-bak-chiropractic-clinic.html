<p>Hey there, readers!</p>
<p>I'm absolutely delighted to share my eye-opening conversation with Dr. Kevin Arnold from BAK Clinic! Throughout our conversation, he taught me about every process that chiropractors go through in their day-to-day life; and just from this call alone, I could already tell he is a pro at what he does (and a teacher!) ! </p>
<p>To start off, Dr. Arnold is no ordinary chiropractor – he's the one behind the wellness of some of Canada's greatest Olympic athletes. But, his chiropractic care isn't limited to athletes alone – it's for everyone, from the ages of 6 months to 100 years! His clinic specializes in tackling neck pain, back pain, nutrition issues, and so much more. It's a hub of health, a place where diagnosis and treatment meet transformation!</p>
<p>Kevin has been in the healing industry for 34 years, and has had quite the journey to opening up his clinic! He could tell that he enjoyed healing, so he decided to go to university for nutrition courses, and found out it was very similar to chiropractic care. From there, he received 3 opportunities, to continue medical school, continue chiropractic school, or help do research at UofT. He chose the chiropractic route, and from then on, he became a successful chiropractor! Now, he’s the owner, operator, and manager of BAK clinic. He does the business planning, and ensures the quality of service. </p>
<p>When I asked him about success and what he loves to do, he really dove into depth about it, truly showing his passion for his work. To Dr. Arnold, success is defined by the quality of life he can provide for his patients. It’s not all about the money for him, it’s about how he can help them and their overall lifestyle. Next, he talked about when he was in the zone, and what he enjoys doing, which is diagnosing his patients. To his clients, who typically have lost hope with other doctors, Dr. Arnold’s work brings faith back. He finds the issue, and then makes out a plan to manage, or even solve their pain!   </p>
<p>And now, for the daily routine. For Dr. Arnold, a business day has two parts; the operating side, and the medical  care. Some days, he starts off by going into meetings, then moving on to organizing the rooms, the supplies, and the schedule. From there, he starts seeing his patients, and, as I said before, diagnosing and treating their issues.</p>
<p>A small but cool side note: When I heard that he helped clients as young as 6 months, I immediately got interested. One thing that I’d never known before is how chiropractors could treat patients as young as that! Thanks to Dr. Arnold, he helped me learn about it. Pretty much what would happen is the mother would bring in her infant, usually for crying over things other than food or diaper issues; and then Dr. Arnold would find a knot in the baby’s cartilage, and then use a gente, modified technique to help heal the child back to comfort.   </p>
<p>That's a wrap for now, readers! Stay tuned for more exclusive interviews and captivating stories – I've got it all coming your way. Until next time!</p>
